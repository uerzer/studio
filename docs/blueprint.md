    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Backend server will make secure calls to the Gemini API.
        *   **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully craft prompts including user context (tasks, deadlines, goals, history, energy level, task types, potentially anonymized patterns from similar users) to elicit desired outputs (ranked task list, suggested cycle, insights, time estimates).
        *   **Input:** Structured data (JSON preferable) and potentially natural language descriptions of tasks/goals.
        *   **Output:** Parse Gemini's responses (likely JSON or structured text) to extract suggestions, insights, or estimations.
        *   **State Management:** Maintain user-specific historical data to feed into prompts for personalization.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust handling for API errors, rate limits, or unexpected responses from Gemini. Provide fallback mechanisms (e.g., default cycles, manual selection).
        *   **Cost Management:** Monitor API usage and associated costs. Optimize prompts and caching where possible.
*   **7.3 External Integrations:**
    *   Use official APIs and OAuth 2.0 for authentication with services like Todoist, Asana, Notion.
    *   Implement mechanisms for periodic syncing or webhooks (if available) to keep task data current.

**9. Open Questions / Assumptions**

*   What is the exact algorithm/weighting for task prioritization using Gemini? Needs experimentation.
*   How much historical data is needed before AI suggestions become truly effective?
*   What is the acceptable latency for Gemini API responses?
*   How will potential Gemini API costs impact the business model?
*   Specific UI/UX details for presenting AI insights and suggestions effectively without overwhelming the user.
*   Initial strategy for handling conflicting task deadlines/priorities.
*   Will users consistently provide energy level input, or should the AI attempt to infer it?
*   Assumes users are willing to grant necessary permissions for integrations and optional distraction monitoring.

This PRD provides a comprehensive starting point. The next steps would involve prioritizing these features (e.g., using MoSCoW method - Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have), creating detailed user flows, designing wireframes/mockups, and beginning technical prototyping, especially around the Gemini API interactions.
